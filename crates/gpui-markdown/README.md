# gpui-markdown

A small **Markdown renderer for [GPUI](https://www.gpui.rs/)**, built on gpui's own
`StyledText` / `InteractiveText` so paragraphs wrap properly and links are clickable
through a real **callback** — unlike renderers that only `cx.open_url` externally.

It is host-agnostic: styling comes in via `MarkdownStyle`, and the host supplies
closures for clicking a `[[wiki-link]]`/`#tag`, rendering an image, rendering a
mermaid diagram, syntax-highlighting code, and click-to-caret. Standard
`[text](url)` links open externally.

**📖 Full reference:** every public item, with signatures, parameter tables,
return contracts, edge cases, and cost notes, lives in [API.md](API.md).

This is **the** markdown crate of the Zorite workspace, in two layers:

- **`gpui_markdown::syntax`** — always compiled, **dependency-free**: the shared
  construct *recognition* (linkables, GitHub alert kinds + fold chars, table
  styles, heading scales, `key:: value` properties, ` ^block-id` anchors,
  `#Heading` / `#^id` link-target splitting, and `![[embed]]` lines with
  block/section extraction) that this reader, the
  [`gpui-editor`](../gpui-editor/README.md) WYSIWYG
  view, and the PDF exporter all consume, so what a construct IS is defined once.
- **The reader view** — `MarkdownView` and everything around it, behind the
  default-on **`view`** feature, which owns the `gpui` + `markdown` dependencies.
  Consumers that only need recognition (like gpui-editor) depend with
  `default-features = false`.

## Features

- Headings, paragraphs, **bold** / *italic* / ~~strikethrough~~ / `inline code` /
  `<mark>` highlight, hard breaks
- Bullet / numbered / nested / **task** lists (`- [ ]` / `- [x]`), blockquotes,
  fenced code blocks, thematic breaks
- GFM **tables** — content-measured columns, column alignment, plus **per-table
  visual designs** (striped / header-shaded / minimal) chosen by a hidden
  `<!-- table:STYLE -->` marker
- **Bidirectional text** — a block containing right-to-left prose is broken in
  *logical* order and laid out row by row via
  [`gpui-bidi`](../gpui-bidi/README.md), then mirrored: alignment, list markers,
  quote and callout rules, table column order, property rows. Links keep their
  colour, hitboxes and hover cursor inside reordered runs, and inline rasters
  sit on their spacer's real visual box. A left-to-right block containing a
  Persian phrase gets the mapping but stays left-aligned.
- **GitHub alerts** — `> [!NOTE]` / `[!TIP]` / `[!IMPORTANT]` / `[!WARNING]` /
  `[!CAUTION]` blockquotes render with a colored bar, bold title, and optional
  host-supplied icons; the natural inline form (`> [!NOTE] like so`) works too.
  Obsidian's **fold char** makes a callout collapsible — `> [!NOTE]-` renders
  folded (title + chevron only), `+` open; clicking the title dispatches to
  `on_alert_toggle` so the host can flip the char in the source
- **Collapsible headings** — every heading gets a hover-revealed fold chevron;
  a folded heading's whole section is skipped. The fold set is host-owned
  (`folded_headings` + `on_heading_toggle`) since this view is rebuilt every frame
- **Properties** — consecutive `key:: value` lines render as a two-column
  panel: per-key icons (via `MarkdownStyle::property_icon`), muted keys, and
  values with `#tag` / `[[wiki-link]]` segments as clickable pills
- **Block ids, anchors & embeds** — a trailing ` ^block-id` marker hides from
  the rendered text; `[[Note#Heading]]` / `[[Note#^id]]` link targets display
  as `Note → anchor`; and a standalone `![[Note]]` line **transcludes** the
  target's content in a quoted box via a host resolver (`on_embed`), nested
  embeds included
- **Inline (in-flow) images** — an image that doesn't lead its paragraph
  renders as a small in-flow thumbnail via `on_inline_image`, wrapping with
  the text; a click dispatches to `on_image_preview`
- **Clickable task checkboxes** — a `- [ ]` box click dispatches its source
  offset to `on_task_toggle` so the host can flip `[ ]`↔`[x]` and persist
- **Syntax highlighting** — fenced code with a language tag colors its tokens via
  a host-supplied `on_highlight` closure (bring your own engine; Zorite passes
  gpui-component's tree-sitter highlighter)
- **Footnotes** and reference-style `[text][id]` links/images; raw HTML shown
  literally (never executed)
- `[[wiki-links]]` (and `[[target|label]]` aliases) and `#tags` → clickable,
  dispatched to your callback
- **Images**, **mermaid diagrams**, and **math** — `$$…$$` blocks and inline
  `$…$` formulas — rendered by host-supplied closures (the host owns loading /
  async render / interaction); each falls back gracefully (math → its raw LaTeX)
- **In-page find** — highlight matches and scroll the active one into view
  (`search` + `find_matches` / `match_count`)
- **Click-to-caret** — report the source offset nearest a click, for entering an
  editor at the clicked character (`on_click_source`)
- `SNIPPETS` — authoring snippets a host can surface in a `/` command palette
- **Editor helpers** — pure `(text, caret)` transforms (no gpui/input dependency)
  for building a Markdown editor: list continuation, indent/outdent, and re-indent

See [`sample.md`](sample.md) for a document exercising everything.

## Quick start

```rust
use std::rc::Rc;
use gpui_markdown::{MarkdownView, MarkdownStyle};

// In a render method, returning an `impl IntoElement`:
MarkdownView::new("note-1", source_text)          // unique id + markdown source
    .style(MarkdownStyle::default())              // or map your theme onto it
    .on_wiki_link(Rc::new(|title, window, cx| {
        // navigate to page `title` in your app
    }))
    .on_image(Rc::new(|info| { /* render a real image */ todo!() }))
    .on_mermaid(Rc::new(|src| { /* render a diagram */ todo!() }))
    .on_math(Rc::new(|latex| { /* typeset a `$$…$$` block → element */ todo!() }))
    .on_inline_math(Rc::new(|latex| { /* inline `$…$` → (raster, w, h) */ None }))
```

`MarkdownView` implements `RenderOnce` (hence `IntoElement`), so it drops into any
GPUI element tree. The full builder surface — embeds, folds, find, click-to-caret,
task toggles — is in [API.md](API.md).

## Per-table visual designs

A GFM table can carry a **hidden style marker** — an HTML comment on the line
directly above it — that the renderer honors and hides:

```markdown
<!-- table:striped -->
| Name  | Role     |
|:------|:---------|
| Ada   | Engineer |
```

| Marker | Look |
| --- | --- |
| *(none)* / `<!-- table:grid -->` | full outer box + all gridlines (default) |
| `<!-- table:striped -->` | alternate body rows shaded; a rule under the header |
| `<!-- table:header -->` | only the header row shaded |
| `<!-- table:minimal -->` | no box/gridlines; a rule under the header |

Shading uses `MarkdownStyle::code_bg`; borders use `muted_color`. Any other Markdown
viewer just ignores the comment and shows a plain table, so the marker degrades
gracefully.

## Supported syntax

Every node `ParseOptions::gfm()` produces is rendered: headings, paragraphs,
bold/italic/strikethrough/inline-code, links (inline, autolink, reference-style),
images, ordered/unordered/nested/task lists, blockquotes (nested), fenced code,
thematic breaks, tables (with alignment + the per-table designs above), footnotes
(references + definitions), and raw HTML (shown literally — except `<mark>…</mark>`,
honored as a highlight). Plus **math** — `$$…$$` blocks (`math_flow`) and inline
`$…$` (`math_text`), typeset by a host renderer — and Zorite-style
`[[wiki-links]]` and `#tags`.

Not handled (not enabled by `gfm()`): frontmatter (YAML/TOML) and MDX. Footnote
references render as `[label]` markers but aren't click-to-jump (that would need
anchors this text-based renderer doesn't have).

Also rendered: **GitHub alerts** on blockquotes (both marker forms, plus the
foldable `-`/`+` variant), Zorite-style `[[wiki-links]]` and `#tags`
(namespaced `#a/b` included — the grammar is the shared `syntax` module's),
`[[Note#Heading]]` / `[[Note#^id]]` anchors (displayed as `Note → anchor`),
trailing ` ^block-id` markers (hidden), `key:: value` **property panels**,
standalone `![[Note]]` **embeds**, and table-style / math-alignment control
comments, which — like all HTML comments — never render.

The `syntax` module's recognizers back all of it and are public — every one is
documented in [API.md](API.md).

## Status

Feature-complete for CommonMark + GFM. The view parses with the
[`markdown`](https://crates.io/crates/markdown) crate (mdast); `syntax` is pure
text and dependency-free. Not yet published to crates.io (gpui is a git-only
dependency).
