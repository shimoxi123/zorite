## Notes & navigation
- [ ] Block references: **"Copy block link"** — auto-generate a ` ^id` on a line
  (right-click / command) and put `[[Page#^id]]` on the clipboard, so linking to
  a block doesn't require inventing an id by hand
- [ ] Properties: **typed values** (list / date / number) — today every value is
  text; types would enable sorting/filtering on the Properties page and smarter
  pills

## Notebooks (multiple data folders)

Obsidian-style multiple "vaults" — separate, self-contained data sets the user
switches between (work / personal / a shared folder in Dropbox). **Not called
vaults**; working name **Notebooks** (alternatives considered: Spaces,
Workspaces, Collections). **Phase 1 COMPLETE on `feat/notebooks`** (2026-07-08,
live-tested end to end — the checklist lives under Completed); only Phase 2
remains, if demand appears.

**Phase 2 — restartless switching / notebooks open side-by-side (only if
Phase 1 proves demand):**
- The crux: `paths::data_dir()` is a process-wide `OnceLock` and every store
  resolves through it — per-window notebooks means threading a data-dir
  context through every `paths::*` call site (the big refactor).
- Per-notebook `DocSignal` (today one process-global would cross-sync
  different notebooks' windows), block cross-notebook tab drags
  (`GlobalAppWindows`), audit per-`AppView` caches (image/mermaid/highlight
  stores are per-window already; the parse cache is content-keyed, safe).

**Out of scope** (matching Obsidian): cross-notebook links/search/embeds,
per-notebook settings sync.

## Performance
- [ ] Move SQLite writes off the UI thread (background executor) — **fsync stall handled** for now via WAL + `synchronous = NORMAL` in `Db::open` (per-keystroke autosave no longer fsyncs on the UI thread; measured worst case ~1.2 ms at a 50k-char page, well within a frame). The full off-thread refactor is now a lower-priority fast-follow (pathological pages / slow or contended disks)

## Cditor audit (2026-07-17)

Findings from a full sweep of JYChen-8866's Cditor codebase against zorite
(four parallel reviews: input/IME, rendering perf, features, markdown engines).
His `ding-board` whiteboard fork is already adopted. Costs: S/M/L.

**Bugs (fix first — 1–6 make a good single batch):**
- [x] **Table column insert/delete corrupts `\|` cells** — `rewrite_table_columns`
  splits raw + rejoins without re-escaping; a cell containing a pipe becomes two
  cells / shifts columns (data loss). Lift Cditor's `escape_table_cell`
  unescape-on-split / re-escape-on-join. (S)
- [x] **Editor splits table cells on escaped `\|`** — `table_cells` is a blind
  `split('|')`; the reader (GFM) treats `\|` as a literal pipe → grid, caret,
  and click hit-tests disagree with the rendered table. (S/M)
- [x] **CRLF paste** — no `\r\n` normalization anywhere in gpui-editor; Windows/
  browser pastes inject literal `\r` (garbled render + column-math desync).
  Normalize in `paste` + IME `replace_text_in_range`. (S)
- [x] **Paste into a table cell breaks the row** — paste inserts `\n`/`|`
  verbatim even though Enter is carefully guarded (`caret_in_table`); sanitize
  (newline→space, escape pipes) or route like Cditor's cell paste. (M)
- [x] **Double-backtick code spans** — `` ``a`b`` `` closes at the wrong
  backtick (only single-` matched); detect the backtick-run length first. (S)
- [x] **Backslash escapes ignored for `*` `` ` `` `~` `[`** — only `_` checks;
  `\*text\*` styles in WYSIWYG but shows literal in the reader. Shared
  `is_escaped` helper (one exists for math). (S/M)
- [x] **Nested inline inside emphasis dropped** — `**bold *italic* bold**` /
  `` **bold `code`** ``: scan_line consumes the outer construct wholesale, inner
  marks render literal; reader nests correctly. Needs body re-scan. (M/L)
- [x] Table well-formedness: body rows with a different cell count than the
  header render ragged (Cditor rejects); validate in `table_regions`. (S)

**Performance (gpui-editor):**
- [x] **Document shaped TWICE per frame** — `shape_document` runs in the measure
  closure AND prepaint with identical inputs; memoize one frame's result across
  the two passes. Halves editor cost, removes a divergence hazard. (S)
- [x] **Cross-frame shaped-line cache** — every blink/hover reshapes every
  visible day's full text; adopt Cditor's `LayoutCacheKey` (content version +
  width bucket + font/theme/scale). gpui-markdown's `PARSE_CACHE` is the
  in-repo template. (M)
- [x] **IME UTF-16↔UTF-8 mapping is O(document) per call** — scan from the
  caret's line start instead of byte 0; CJK composition latency currently grows
  with note size. Also: `bounds_for_range` anchors the candidate window at the
  composition START (zero-width) — return the marked range's real span. (S/M)
- [x] Whole-document scans in `shape_document` (`ordered_numbers`,
  `mermaid_blocks`, `math_regions`, selection `row_of`) recomputed 2×/frame —
  memoize on the content version once the cache exists. (S)
- [x] **Table cells re-measured every frame** (`table_row_wrap_rows` +
  `paint_table_row` shape per cell per paint) — cache by (content version,
  column-width bucket). (M)
- [x] **Scroll anchoring** — an async math/mermaid/image render above the
  viewport jumps the content the user is reading; Cditor's
  `AnchorFrame::restore_once` (capture top-visible row before shaping, restore
  after height deltas) fixes it without windowing. (M)
- [x] `apply_auto_replace` rescans all lines above for fence parity on every
  boundary keystroke — cache/bound it. (S)
- [x] **Windowed rendering + estimated heights** — Cditor's actual 100k-block
  machinery (render window + spacers, estimated↔measured convergence, budgeted
  layout); the editor's only L-sized perf item, defer until someone has a huge
  note. (L)

**Features (natural markdown fits, from his UI):**
- [x] **"Turn into" block conversion menu** — right-click/handle menu converting
  a block between text/H1–3/lists/todo/quote/callout/code/math, with the
  current kind checked; flat-markdown natural (rewrite the prefix). (M)
- [x] **Block drag-reorder** — gutter grip drag to move a block/line (his
  gutter_drag + move-subtree pipeline; ours = reorder markdown lines). (M/L)
- [ ] **Type-to-filter search in the table menu** — the menu is 18 rows now;
  his cell menu filters by label + keywords as you type. (S/M)
- [ ] **Clear contents** verb (cell/row/column) in the table menu. (S)
- [ ] **⌘D duplicate** keybinding + shortcut hints rendered in menu rows. (S)
- [x] Wide-table **horizontal scroll** instead of scaling columns down — UX
  decision; his tables scroll in-place with their own scrollbar. (M)
- Skipped (no markdown representation): text/background color marks, cell
  merge/split, per-cell backgrounds, header *columns*, toggle-list containers.

**Ultrareview of PR #52 (2026-07-18)** — non-blocking findings (the two
blockers, occluded grip presses + turn-into grammar, were fixed in 3c050f6):

*Correctness-adjacent:*
- [ ] Feed-window day heights are keyed by child POSITION and invalidated only
  on width change — key by date + invalidate on content change so a day-set or
  offscreen-content change can't leave stale spacer heights. (S)
- [x] Caret-parked-on-marker is patched at two entry points (resize-band press,
  `rewrite_table_marker`); other focus-without-caret-move affordances (pills,
  delete handles, code Copy, fold chevrons, image grips) can still flash raw
  markers — enforce "caret never rests on a collapsed marker line" once in the
  collapse/caret logic. (M)

*Per-frame / per-event efficiency (gpui-editor):*
- [x] Window-level MouseMove listener runs `editor.update` + a full line scan
  in EVERY loaded editor per pointer move — gate on markdown_style + a y-range
  early-out (or register only for the hovered editor). (S)
- [x] Windowed skip path still hashes every offscreen line twice and makes an
  empty `shape_runs` call per line per frame; lines containing `$`/`![` never
  window — key heights by (row, content_gen, epoch), make the placeholder
  cheap (`Option<WrappedLine>`), derive eligibility from scan output. (M/L)
  DONE via a per-row content-key memo (hash 3 u64s/line steady-state, diags
  invalidate explicitly). Deliberately NOT taken: (row, content_gen) height
  keys (would invalidate ALL offscreen heights per keystroke) and the
  `Option<WrappedLine>` placeholder (the empty shape_runs is a gpui cache
  hit); the `$`/`![` eligibility gates stay (conservative, correct).
- [x] `line_runs` cache HIT deep-clones (String + Vec<TextRun> + Vec<usize>)
  per visible line per frame — store the payload behind an `Rc`. (S)
- [x] `region_cols` cache rehashes all table text + clones the width vecs per
  frame even on a hit — key on content_gen instead, store `Rc`. (S)
- [x] `on_scroll_wheel` walks O(lines) before the `dx == 0` check — hoist. (S)
- [x] Slash flyout rebuilds its item Vec every frame while open (+ twice per
  arrow key for nth/len) — cache on the Slash state per selected category. (S)

*Dedup / structure:*
- [x] Scrolled-table content-left (`bounds.left + GUTTER - sx`) is hand-built
  at 6+ sites and paint re-implements the clamp inline — one shared
  `table_left`/`table_avail` helper. (S)
- [x] `ShapedLines` is a 9-tuple with 7 hand-replicated placeholder-push sites
  — a named struct + one `push_placeholder` helper. (M)
- [x] Fence-block walk ×3 + quote-run walk ×3 (turn_into, drag_block_rows,
  snap_drop_boundary/block_kind_at) — `fence_block_rows` + `quote_run_rows`
  helpers. (S)
- [x] `is_backslash_escaped` duplicates `is_escaped` in markdown_syntax.rs —
  delete one. (S)
- [x] `grip_hover_row_at` hand-mirrors the prepaint grip geometry (26 vs
  grip_left−4 constants) — extract one shared row/band computation. (S)
- [x] `menu_turn_into` belongs inside `DiagMenu` (dies with the menu; today
  it's sticky once hovered and reset at only one open site). (S)

## v0.11.0 — i18n (analysis 2026-07-18)

~550–600 user-facing strings: settings.rs ~200 (labels + search keywords),
app.rs ~120 (dialogs/menus/errors), src/ui/* ~150, slash.rs ~50 (labels AND
search keywords), dates.rs 19 (hardcoded English month/weekday names),
gpui-editor ~40 (clipboard verbs, Turn-into kinds, table menu, code chrome),
whiteboard/pdf/markdown ~20 (toolbars, alert titles). Already done for free:
spellcheck follows the OS locale (both platforms); whiteboard has CJK font
fallback.

**Architecture:** `rust-i18n` (YAML per locale, `t!()`, compile-time embedded,
runtime switch via full re-render) + `sys-locale` for the Auto default +
a Settings → Language picker persisted like theme mode. Fluent is the upgrade
path if plural-heavy languages ever hurt. **Crates stay host-agnostic**: no
`t!` in crates/* — inject small `Labels` structs with English defaults
(the `SyntaxStyle` pattern; `set_labels(...)` on editor/whiteboard/pdf).

**Decisions:**
- Alert titles localize via injected labels in BOTH engines (cross-view rule);
  `[!NOTE]` source keywords are GFM syntax — never translated.
- Dates: i18n keys for 12 months + 7 weekdays (no chrono/icu dep); us/eu/long
  format options unchanged.
- Slash search matches localized labels PLUS English aliases.
- DB-stored names ("Journal", "Templates", titles) are user data — never
  migrated; localize only creation-time defaults; Templates lookup keeps
  matching the stored name.
- RTL (Arabic/Hebrew) explicitly OUT of scope — gpui has no real bidi.
- Docs site: Starlight i18n is a separate, optional effort.

**RTL / bidi (issue #66 — Persian/Farsi, revised 2026-07-24).** The earlier
"out of scope, gpui has no bidi" was too blunt. What the code actually shows:
gpui's `LineLayout::x_for_index` / `index_for_x` / `closest_index_for_x`
(gpui `text_system/line_layout.rs:58-115`) walk glyphs assuming byte index and
visual x rise together. That is false for RTL, and Zorite's editor is built
entirely on `position_for_index` / `index_for_mouse_position` — so **caret
placement, selection, and click-to-caret are LTR-only at the gpui layer**,
independent of whether the shaper reorders glyphs. Splitting #66 accordingly:

- *Reader view is reachable.* It has no caret and no hit-testing to speak of —
  per-block direction detection (first strong character, UAX #9 P2/P3) plus
  alignment is layout we already control. That alone makes Persian notes
  readable, which is the reporter's blocking need.
- *Editor view needs a bidi layer we own.* Right-aligning without fixing the
  index↔x mapping gives a caret that lands in the wrong place on every RTL
  line — worse than not shipping it. Upstream gpui is not accepting
  modifications (confirmed 2026-07-24), so the fix is ours: a logical↔visual
  run map layered over `LineLayout`, driving caret placement, selection
  ranges, and click hit-testing. `unicode-bidi` 0.3 is already in the tree
  (via lopdf/usvg), so this is an adapter over the UAX #9 algorithm, not an
  implementation of it. **This is the one part that earns its own crate**
  (`crates/gpui-bidi`, the os-spellcheck shape: one hard isolated problem, a
  small API, GPU-free tests, useful to any gpui app) — but only when we start
  the editor side. Direction *detection* stays in `gpui_markdown::syntax`
  with the other shared recognizers; it's one function and the sanctioned
  editor→markdown edge already carries it.
- *Storage:* direction is derived, not stored. The reporter asks for
  persistence, but a per-line attribute has nowhere to live in portable
  markdown; auto-detection is deterministic from the text, and a manual
  override would need a marker that other editors would show as junk. Revisit
  only if auto-detection proves insufficient in practice.
- *Shaping is fine; the mapping is what's broken* (measured 2026-07-24 with a
  throwaway gpui probe, macOS/CoreText — the cosmic-text path runs
  `Shaping::Advanced`, which is likewise bidi-aware):
  - Glyphs DO come back correctly reordered into visual order. For
    `"سلام دنیا"` the glyph indices run 15, 13, 11, 9, 8, 6, 2, 0 while x
    ascends — visual order, logical indices, exactly as UAX #9 wants. So
    **rendering RTL text already works**; nothing needs a shaper change.
  - `x_for_index` is unusable: it returns the first glyph whose
    `index >= target`, and the first glyph of an RTL line has the HIGHEST
    index — so every offset 0..15 in that string returns **x = 0.00**. Every
    caret position in a pure-RTL line collapses onto the left edge.
  - `index_for_x` / `closest_index_for_x` are equally wrong (`closest` gave
    0, 13, 9, 8, 6, 2, 0, 17 across evenly spaced x).
  - Mixed content is worse, not better: in `"hello سلام world"` the four
    offsets 6, 8, 10, 12 all map to x = 38.25.
  This confirms the split above: reader view needs alignment only, editor
  view needs the mapping layer.
- *Constraint on that layer:* `ShapedLine.layout` is `pub(crate)` in gpui, so
  we cannot post-process its glyph table — only the `Deref`'d public methods
  (`x_for_index`, `index_for_x`, `runs`) are reachable. `runs` IS public via
  the deref, which is how the probe read the glyph table, so a visual-order
  map can be built on top without forking gpui. Verify that still holds at
  each gpui bump.
- Table cell alignment, list-marker side, and the gutter/grip side all flip
  with direction — reader-side only for now.

**Phases:** 1–5 landed together in PR #70 (@shimoxi123) rather than in
sequence — a 663-key catalog, zh-CN, and the crate `Labels` wiring in one
change. What the plan called for and what shipped:

- [x] 1. Scaffold: rust-i18n 4 + sys-locale + catalogs + Settings language
  picker. (One file per locale, `locales/en.yml` + `locales/zh-CN.yml`,
  rather than the single combined file first sketched — better for a
  translator who wants to own one file.)
- [x] 2. Settings window — done as part of the sweep, not as a separate
  proving ground.
- [x] 3. App chrome sweep: dialogs, menus, sidebar, slash palette, dates.
- [x] 4. Crate `Labels` structs + host wiring (editor + reader context menus).
- [x] 5. zh-CN.
- [x] 6. Per-locale QA — done for zh-CN, and it found nothing to fix. Worth
  recording why, so the next locale is measured rather than eyeballed:
  - **Width is a non-issue for CJK.** Measured across the catalog in visual
    columns (CJK/fullwidth = 2, latin = 1): only 27 of 635 strings are wider
    in zh-CN, 608 are the same or narrower, and the widest delta (+11 cols)
    is an error message, not chrome. The tightest boxes in the app — the
    84/92px All-pages column headers — hold 「创建时间」at ~44px.
  - **Height was the real risk**, since CJK glyphs are full-body where latin
    sits at cap-height: 25 fixed-height text containers, tightest at 14–20px
    (the `alias::` row, page title, calendar cells, properties rows).
    Inspected in a zh-CN build — nothing clipped.
  - A LATIN locale is the one to actually worry about: German/French run
    ~1.3–1.5× wider than English, which is the direction those 84px columns
    have no slack for. Re-run the column measurement before offering one.

Follow-ups from reviewing #70 (fixed in the branch that follows it):
- `apply_locale` must also call `gpui_component::set_locale` — the toolkit
  keeps its OWN catalog (it ships zh-CN) and would otherwise leave calendars,
  dialogs and pickers in English inside an otherwise-Chinese app.
- The locale has to be applied before the first window, read straight from the
  database file: on a locked notebook `AppView` doesn't exist yet, so the
  unlock screen rendered in English.
- Still open: alert titles (`[!NOTE]` labels) aren't localized in either
  engine, and slash-command search matches localized labels only — the plan
  wants English aliases to keep working too.

## App & polish
- [ ] **Graph-node context menu** — nodes hit-test inside one
  canvas element (`g.hit(position)`), so the shared page-menu builder
  doesn't attach; needs the app's overlay-menu machinery (the reader
  ctx-menu recipe)
- [ ] **PopupMenu density** — the pinned gpui-component rev has a
  `Size::Small` branch for menus (20px rows vs 26px) but NO public setter;
  upstream a `Sizable` impl for `PopupMenu` (or bump the pin when one
  exists), then `.small()` the page menus to match the custom ones
- [ ] **Download/region analytics** — GitHub Releases exposes per-asset download *totals* only (good for a platform split via a polling script), never geography; winget/tap/bucket/Nix expose nothing. For regions: (1) GoatCounter or Plausible on the docs site — visitor countries, one script tag, best effort/signal; (2) download links through a Cloudflare Worker logging `CF-IPCountry` → 302 to the GitHub asset (only covers clicks on our links); (3) pointing the app's update check at our own endpoint would map the active install base but is telemetry — against the local-first pitch, needs disclosure + opt-out; avoid
- [ ] **Visual design pass** — make the UI look professional and easy on the eyes (spacing, typography, color, density)
- [ ] Multi-window: same-page **concurrent edits** are last-write-wins — editing the *same* page/day in two windows at once can drop one side's changes. True resolution needs a CRDT/OT layer (out of scope for a single-user app); revisit only if real-time collaboration is ever wanted

## Import & export
- [ ] Logseq import follow-ups: an in-progress indicator with real progress (it's a bare "may take a minute" dialog today); surface imported pages in the sidebar right away (a fresh DB shows "No recent pages" until things are visited)
- [ ] PDF: **garbled quotes from decorative fonts** — some heading fonts decode to shifted/garbled unicode (e.g. a −29 glyph shift), so a highlight on them stores garbled text (it still re-locates, since garbled matches garbled); body text is correct. Upstream hayro limitation
- [ ] PDF forms, follow-ups — remaining niceties: synthesized-appearance
  fidelity (`/DA` fonts, `/Q` quadding, comb fields, multiline), and
  **filing the two hayro gaps upstream** (state-dict `/AP /N` selected by
  `/AS`; `NeedAppearances` synthesis) so the lopdf normalization pass can
  eventually retire.

## Crates
Crate-internal defects and API hygiene, mostly surfaced by the 2026-07-06
public-API audit (every crate now carries a complete `API.md`; these are the
findings worth fixing rather than just documenting):
- [x] `ratex-gpui`: **accents in the structural editor** (#77 — can't type
  `$\hat{X}$`). Three gaps, scoped 2026-08-25:
  1. `Atom::Accent { accent, base }` — model + `to_latex` + parser mapping
     (`ParseNode::Accent` currently *degrades to its inner content*, so
     opening an existing `$\hat{X}$` in the editor and committing silently
     rewrites it as `$X$` — data loss) + `Command::Accent` entries (hat,
     widehat, bar, overline, vec, tilde, dot, ddot; caret into the base
     slot) + geometry/cursor/render walks. `Sqrt` is the single-slot
     template. The bulk of the work (~a session).
  2. `{` / `}` arms in `type_char` — today `{` becomes `Atom::Sym("{")`,
     a bare TeX group-open that renders as nothing (the reported "brace
     never shows"). `{` should open the literal `\{…\}` Delim mirroring
     `(`; `}` hops out mirroring `)`. ~10 lines; ships independently.
  3. Escape `{`/`}` (and other TeX-active chars) in `Sym` serialization so
     a stray brace can never emit invalid source. Falls out of 2; add a test.
  **SHIPPED 2026-08-25 (PR #81)** — plus dropdown UX, drag-selection,
  selection-wrap on `\command`, palette accent row, and the first-line-block
  up-arrow guard found in live testing.
- [ ] `ratex-gpui`: **duplicate `"angle"` command** in the `input.rs` `COMMANDS`
  table — the ⟨⟩ delimiter pair shadows the `\angle` symbol entry (first-match
  lookup), so the symbol is unreachable by name; rename one (e.g. `langle`
  `rangle` for the delimiters, matching LaTeX)
- [ ] `gpui-whiteboard`: `Font::layout_wrapped` / `layout_styled` are `pub` but
  return **crate-private types** (unnameable outside — `layout_styled` is
  effectively uncallable externally); demote to `pub(crate)` or export the types
- [ ] `gpui-whiteboard`: the `PasteFn` doc comment in `lib.rs` says keyboard ⌘V
  is handled internally, but ⌘V actually routes through `on_paste` (with `None`
  deliberately propagating so a clipboard image can paste) — fix the comment to
  match `API.md`
- [ ] Extract editor features (e.g. the slash menu) into a reusable crate if they generalize
- [ ] Publish to crates.io once the API is stable
- [ ] **Split the reusable crates (`gpui-markdown`, `gpui-pdf`) into their own repos** so outside contributors don't have to fork/clone all of Zorite to contribute — **defer until the first stable release**. Gotcha to plan for: the crates use the workspace's pinned gpui rev (`[workspace.dependencies]`, one spec byte-for-byte); in separate repos each picks its own rev, and a mismatch puts two gpui versions in one consumer's build (won't compile), so the revs must be kept in lockstep. Extraction is cheap and lossless when the time comes — `git subtree split -P crates/<name>` carries each crate's history into the new repo. (crates.io publishing stays blocked regardless, since gpui is a git-only dep.)

## Maybe

Ideas worth keeping, not yet committed to.

- [ ] **nixpkgs submission IN REVIEW** — NixOS/nixpkgs#539400 (opened
  2026-07-07): `pkgs/by-name/zo/zorite` at 0.6.0, single `cargoHash`
  (fetchCargoVendor covers the git deps — NOT per-source outputHashes),
  `nix-update-script` so r-ryantm auto-bumps releases, maintainer entry
  for packetThrower, AI-policy disclosure included. Both platforms
  CI-verified pre-submission. When it MERGES: delete `nixpkgs-staging/`
  + the temporary `nixpkgs-staging` CI job from nix.yml, and respond to
  reviewer feedback in the meantime.

- [ ] **MCP server** — let Claude (Desktop / Code) read and eventually write the
  journal. An external agent's draft prompt proposed a standalone binary doing
  direct SQLite writes — analyzed 2026-07-06 and rejected as-written: the app
  autosaves per keystroke from an in-memory copy, so an external write to an
  open day is silently clobbered (no conflict detection; `DocSignal` is
  in-process); external writes also skip the `page_links` reindex, alias/
  collision handling, and the `kind` column; a SQLCipher-encrypted DB can't be
  opened at all; and hardcoded platform paths ignore `data_location.json` +
  `ZORITE_DATA`. The FTS index alone would survive (trigger-maintained).
  **Phase 1 (safe): read-only sidecar.** **Phase 2: writes only via the running
  app** (in-process MCP endpoint or a stdio shim over a local socket, so saves
  run `save_page_content` → link reindex → `DocSignal`). Corrected prompt for
  Phase 1:

  > Add a `zorite-mcp` binary to the Zorite workspace (a new workspace member
  > following AGENTS.md — fmt/clippy `-D warnings`/test gate, cross-platform,
  > no native deps): a **read-only** MCP server over **stdio** using the
  > official Rust SDK (`rmcp` — modelcontextprotocol/rust-sdk) and `rusqlite`.
  >
  > Open the database read-only (`mode=ro`, `busy_timeout`); WAL makes
  > cross-process reads safe (the app itself opens one connection per window).
  > Resolve the data dir exactly like `src/paths.rs`: `ZORITE_DATA` env →
  > the `data_location.json` pointer in the OS-default dir → platform default.
  > If the file starts with the SQLCipher header (not `SQLite format 3\0`),
  > return a clear "database is encrypted — the MCP server can't read it"
  > error; likewise clean JSON-RPC errors for a missing file.
  >
  > Use the real schema (see `src/db.rs`, schema v9): `pages(id, title,
  > is_journal, journal_date, content, created_at, updated_at, kind)`,
  > `page_links(source_id, target_id)`, `page_aliases`, and the
  > external-content trigram FTS5 table `pages_fts`. No placeholders.
  >
  > Tools (all read-only):
  > - `list_pages` — id/title/kind/updated_at only (never bodies); filter
  >   `kind = 'page'` by default, flag whiteboards.
  > - `get_page` — body by title (case-insensitive, alias-aware via

## Completed

### Post-0.8.0 (unreleased)
- [x] **Line numbers for pages** — Settings → Appearance toggle (off by
  default): a margin **gutter rail** beside a page's editor (WYSIWYG + raw),
  hanging absolutely in the left padding so the text column never shifts —
  and a UI surface of its own for future per-line affordances. Logical lines
  (wraps count once), folds skipped, off-screen rows unshaped; reader stays
  clean (add later if wanted). `EditorState::row_layout` in gpui-editor
- [x] **Rich-text copy** — Copy/Cut and the page menu's "Copy contents" now
  write rendered HTML beside the raw markdown (one `arboard` transaction —
  gpui's clipboard has NO html flavor, contrary to this entry's original
  premise), so rich targets paste formatting and plain targets still get
  markdown; graceful fallback to plain if the platform write fails. Explicit
  **"Copy as Markdown"** variants (editor menu + page menu) write the raw
  source only, for pasting literal syntax into rich surfaces.
  `EditorState::set_clipboard_writer`/`copy_plain` in gpui-editor
- [x] **Find in the journal feed** — `⌘F` on the Journal opens a floating
  PDF-viewer-style bar (query, n / m, ‹ › step, ✕; Esc closes): matches span
  every loaded day (case-insensitive, Unicode-aware `find_in_source`), with
  highlights + scroll in BOTH modes — WYSIWYG via gpui-editor's new
  `set_search`/`offset_screen_top` (match quads share the selection's
  multi-row geometry), reader via per-day `MarkdownView::search` + tracked
  block bounds. The page find bar gained the same WYSIWYG support (it was
  reader-only)

### 0.8.0
Shipped 2026-07-10 — the full list lives in CHANGELOG.md; the TODO-tracked
items were:
- [x] Aliases: offer a page's aliases as suggestions in `[[` autocomplete — alias rows rank with titles (shown `alias → Title`, inserting `[[alias]]`; exact alias match suppresses Create). `Db::list_aliases` cached with the sidebar page list
- [x] PDF: **fit-width / fit-page** zoom modes — sticky `↔`/`⤢` header controls (re-fit on viewport resize; any manual zoom takes over); `PdfView::fit_width`/`fit_page` in gpui-pdf
- [x] PDF: **area (image-region) highlights** — the `⬚` tool beside the pen: a box-drag marks a page region (figures / scans, no text layer needed), stored on the highlights page as an `@area(x,y,w,h)` quote token (same colors, jump-links, and flash); `Highlight.region` + `toggle_area_mode`/`CreateAreaFn` in gpui-pdf. See `crates/gpui-pdf/src/lib.rs`, `src/pdf.rs`
- [x] PDF: **graceful fallback for unsupported files** — the load-failure pane now offers **"Open in system viewer"** (host launches the OS default app via `open`/`start`/`xdg-open`); `PdfView::set_on_open_external` keeps the crate host-agnostic
- [x] PDF forms: **choice-field dropdowns** — a Ch field's seat editor lists its `/Opt` entries (current highlighted; click commits through the write-and-hot-swap path); typing still covers editable combos
- [x] **Custom cursor themes** (PR #43) — os-cursors crate (NSCursor swizzle / WM_SETCURSOR hook / XCURSOR_* env, no gpui fork), Settings picker, XCursor packs as drop-in content, theme-reactive SVG packs (bundled Bibata + user packs)
- [x] **Remember open tabs** (PR #46) — second switch on the Remember window card; open-tabs sidecar next to the db, restores pages/PDFs/whiteboards/browsers + the active tab, skips vanished targets

### UX papercuts (0.7.0)
From the 2026-07-08 four-way UX audit; shipped in v0.7.0 (PR #42). The two
deferrals moved to App & polish.
- [x] Editor interaction: smart Home; Enter/backspace-join/forward-delete
  around property panels seat the form; block-editor exits at document end
  create a line below; double/triple-click swallowed on $$/property blocks;
  atomic formula deletion (incl. the `<!-- math:ALIGN -->` marker); ⌥←/→
  word-jumps route into constructs; selections reveal the blocks they sweep
- [x] App flows: error-dialog sweep (rename collisions report INLINE in the
  rename dialog — a stacked dialog pops the first off the dialog stack; the
  builder runs inside AppView's render, so dialog-read state goes through
  `Rc<RefCell<…>>`); unified right-click (shared page menu on sidebar /
  All Pages / search / backlinks / page tabs + Copy link / Copy contents;
  editor text menu; property Edit/Delete; compact custom menus); ghost tabs
  close after a cross-window delete
- [x] PDF: terminal load failures render an error pane + emit
  `PdfEvent::LoadFailed` (retry-unlock failing non-password stands the
  prompt down); `is_pdf` sees through URL queries
- [x] Platform: Windows spell-check follows the system UI language;
  the math editor rasterizes at the window's real scale factor
- [x] CLOSED AS FALSE POSITIVES (verified 2026-07-09): "reader lacks file
  chips" — the host's `ImageRenderer` (src/ui/image.rs) classifies
  `is_pdf` and renders chips in both the page and embed renderers, the
  audit only searched gpui-markdown; "embed image-resize writes the wrong
  page" — embeds use the deliberately grip-free `embed_renderer`


### Notebooks Phase 1 + UI polish (unreleased, feat/notebooks / PR #41)
- [x] **Notebooks (multiple data folders), Phase 1** — registry in
  `data_location.json` (`notebooks: [{name, dir}]` beside the active `dir`;
  serde-compatible both ways, tested; active synthesizes as "Main" until the
  first write; moves/settles never delete a pointer holding a registry); a
  **sidebar-bottom chip switcher** (list with ✓, per-row ✎ rename / reveal /
  ✕ remove buttons — inline instead of a context menu, which dies to the
  popover's click-away; one "Add notebook…" whose picked folder decides
  create-fresh vs open-existing); a **Settings → Notebooks tab** with the same
  management + the Data-location card (Move-only; a has-db target directs to
  the switcher); switch = pointer write + relaunch by **respawning
  `current_exe`** (NOT `cx.restart()` — macOS `open`/LaunchServices pops a
  Terminal for bare binaries and drops the env); names persist to a
  `notebook-name` sidecar inside the folder (survive remove/re-add, travel
  with the data, carried by moves); window title gains the notebook name —
  the app's drawn TitleBar label (live-updating via the cached registry), the
  native title only names Mission Control; `ZORITE_DATA` keeps precedence.
  Phase 2 (restartless / side-by-side) remains under Notebooks above
- [x] **Small chrome controls app-wide** (115e826) — gpui-component controls
  in app chrome take `Sizable::small()` (settings cards, sidebar search, graph
  panel, find bars, PDF prompts); the settings `text_button` shrank to match;
  dialogs and focal surfaces keep the default size. Convention in AGENTS.md

### Obsidian parity (0.6.0)
- [x] **Properties (`key:: value` anywhere)** (PR #32) — any-line properties render as a two-column panel (per-key icons, `#tag` / `[[link]]` values as clickable pills, hover highlight) in BOTH views; an **in-place property editor** seated in the note (click or arrow in; key dropdown fed by every key in the vault; full keyboard nav; writes `key:: value` back on blur); and a **Properties index page** (All pages → Properties): every key with its values + pages, icon overrides / pre-mapping from a picker, and rename-a-key-across-the-vault. Recognition shared in `gpui_markdown::syntax`; `alias::` keeps its `page_aliases` DB resolution
- [x] **Block references & heading anchors** (PR #34) — ` ^block-id` gives a line an address; `[[Note#^id]]` and `[[Note#Heading]]` (case-insensitive) open the note scrolled to that line, in both views. Links read as `Note → anchor` (the raw `#^` / `#` renders as ` → `), the trailing `^id` marker hides outside the caret's line, `file.pdf#p3` and literal `#`-titled pages keep their meaning, and the link reindexer no longer spawns junk `Note#…` pages
- [x] **Transclusion / embeds (`![[note]]`)** (PR #34) — a standalone `![[Note]]` / `![[Note#Heading]]` / `![[Note#^id]]` line renders the target's content in a quoted box with a clickable source label, in BOTH views: hover scrollbar + wheel hand-off at the edges, live updates when the source page changes, full inner rendering (images read-only, math, mermaid, highlighted code, nested embeds capped at depth 3), `|alias` renames the label; caret on the line edits the raw text
- [x] **Foldable callouts** — Obsidian's fold char on an alert marker: `> [!NOTE]-` starts folded, `+` open; a chevron joins the title in both views, clicking folds/unfolds and persists the flip in the source (like a task checkbox), and the editor reveals a folded callout while the caret is inside
- [x] **Collapsible headings** (a8da34c) — hover a heading → chevron; click folds its section (to the next same-or-higher heading, fence-aware) in both views. Session-local view state (markdown has no fold syntax); keyed by heading text (self-heals on rename; duplicate headings fold together — known ceiling); editor reveals a folded section while the caret is inside its body
- [x] **Inline (in-flow) images** (PR #30) — an image that doesn't lead its line renders as a small in-flow thumbnail (height-capped, width-capped) instead of vanishing, in BOTH views; click opens a full-size preview, hover shows a hand
- [x] **Obsidian importer** (PR #31) — File → Import from Obsidian… reads a vault: folders → `::` namespaces (or flatten), links + aliases resolve through a name→title map, ~13 callout types → Zorite's 5 alerts, frontmatter → aliases/tags/`key:: value` properties, `YYYY-MM-DD` notes → journal days, assets copied into the managed stores. Block ids, `#Heading`/`#^id` anchors, and `![[embeds]]` come across **as-is** (they all work in Zorite now). **`.canvas` boards → whiteboards**: text cards as labeled boxes (colors mapped), note cards as clickable page cards (ids resolved at write time), image cards placed, groups as outlines, edges as arrows with labels; every 1:1 gap is warned in the import summary

### Export (unreleased)
- [x] **Export Notebook as Markdown** (2026-07-06) — `src/export_md.rs`, the
  importers' mirror: a pure `plan_export` (paths sanitized + case-insensitively
  uniquified, `::` → folders, map-driven link/embed rewriting preserving
  anchors + aliases, fence-aware; frontmatter aliases YAML-quoted; referenced
  assets collected via `all_image_srcs` + pdf-chip links) and a `write_export`
  that refuses non-empty destinations. Kept deliberately portable: `<mark>`,
  `{width=N}`, properties, callouts, block ids all pass through — no
  Obsidian-only conversions. Round-trip tested through our own Obsidian
  importer (`import(export(x)) ≈ x`); live-verified against a seeded coverage
  page.
- [x] **Whiteboards → `.canvas`** (2026-07-06) — the canvas importer's reverse:
  box shapes flatten to text cards (stroke color kept), page cards → file
  nodes at the exported note's path (board-to-board cards keep `.canvas`),
  images → file nodes (assets copied), lines/arrows → edges anchored to the
  nearest node side (24 px snap; arrowheads honored via `toEnd`). Freehand
  strokes and unanchored lines are counted in the summary. Round-trip tested
  back through `read_vault`.

### PDF forms (unreleased)
- [x] **AcroForm display + filling** (2026-07-06, spike -> M1 -> M2 -> M3 in a day) —
  the spike proved hayro already composites `/AP /N` appearance streams, leaving two
  gaps: state-dict appearances (checkboxes/radios) and `NeedAppearances` fields.
  **M1**: `forms` feature in gpui-pdf — a lopdf pass before parse resolves `/AS`
  state dicts and synthesizes missing text appearances (idempotent, encrypted
  files untouched, end-to-end render-tested). **M2**: `form_fields(bytes)`
  (qualified names, kinds, pages, ordered rects, values, options — verified on a
  real 54-field government form) + `set_form_value` (writes `/V` on the
  /FT-owning dict, per-widget `/AS` for button groups, regenerated appearances
  so output renders in every viewer; refuses read-only/signature). **M3**:
  fillable in the viewer — widgets overlay like link annotations (hover tint,
  pointer), `PdfEvent::FieldClicked` carries field + window bounds, checkboxes
  toggle instantly, text fields seat an app-side input BELOW the widget (field
  stays readable; caption with name + key hints), Enter/click-away commits, Esc
  cancels, Tab/Shift-Tab hops fields with `reveal_field` scrolling; writes go
  fs::read -> set_form_value -> fs::write -> `replace_bytes` (no-blanking hot
  swap, the zoom-change pattern — blanking flashed the window black on every
  toggle). Esc/Tab route through the app's existing Input-context actions
  (SlashCancel / InsertTab / Outdent), the same mechanism as the property editor.

### Editor & rendering (0.5.x)
- [x] **gpui-markdown becomes THE markdown crate; gpui-editor consumes it**
  (design agreed 2026-07-02, replacing the earlier third-crate idea). The two
  views recognize every construct separately and drift — links (fixed 0.4.1),
  alerts (recognized in 3 places incl. PDF export), math parse options. Plan:
  1. gpui-markdown owns *recognition* — construct detection + payloads
     (wiki/tag/url linkables, alert kinds + palette, table styles, heading
     scales) — exposed BOTH as mdast helpers and as line-level recognizers
     (the editor can't afford full parses per keystroke). The reader view
     moves behind a default-on `view` feature.
  2. gpui-editor depends on gpui-markdown (recognition only,
     default-features = false) — `markdown_syntax.rs` keeps the scanning
     shape but consumes shared definitions. AGENTS.md's "crates depend on
     gpui only" gains this one sibling exception.
  3. gpui-editor's whole markdown/WYSIWYG side moves behind a default-on
     `markdown` feature — it's a text editor first (ratex-gpui's `editor`
     feature is the precedent).
  **DONE** (2026-07-02) except one deliberate cut: `gpui_markdown::syntax`
  holds alerts, table styles, heading scales, AND the linkables (one grammar —
  unification caught live tag-rule drift and gave WYSIWYG bare-URL autolinks);
  the `view` feature ships (recognition-only builds are dependency-free, the
  editor consumes `default-features = false`). **Cut: the gpui-editor
  `markdown` feature** — ~102 integration points would need cfg or a 30-item
  stub mirror, while the benefit evaporated once recognition became a
  dependency-free module (unused markdown paths are dead-code-eliminated for
  consumers that never call `set_markdown_style`). "Text editor first" is
  documented in the crate README instead. Parity rules live in AGENTS.md.
- [x] Images: **orphan GC** — Settings → General → "Unused images" deletes `images/` files no page, whiteboard, or template references (substring scan of all content; files under an hour old kept for the autosave race)
- [x] Images: import dedupe — pastes AND dragged files reuse any existing store file with identical contents (size-narrowed byte compare), whatever its name; new pastes get content-addressed names (`pasted-<sha256/64bit>.<ext>`). Pre-existing duplicates aren't retro-deduped (would need reference rewriting)
- [x] Images: **AVIF/HEIC/HEIF** decode via the pure-Rust `heic_decoder` (commit 28a5ebd, PR #15) — EXIF orientation applied, rav1d runs on a big-stack thread. Known gap: grid-tiled primary items fall back to a placeholder

### Editor & rendering (0.5.0)
- [x] **WYSIWYG table: delete last row/column caret drop** — no longer reproduces (user-verified 2026-07-02); most likely resolved by the table measure/hit-box overhaul (shared `line_pads`, always-committed strip rects) that fixed the add-row "+" strip
- [x] **Shared construct recognition** (`gpui_markdown::syntax`) — alerts, table styles, heading scales recognized in ONE place; reader, WYSIWYG, and PDF export all consume it (phase 1 of the restructure above)
- [x] **View parity rounds** — reader ↔ WYSIWYG converged per the AGENTS.md parity rules: body line height 1.45 both (reader had gpui's phi default), content-hugging tables (WYSIWYG's measured columns, 22px gutter, row metric) and code cards (widest line, bold-measured for highlight runs), list spacing + indentation (reader's roomier look, WYSIWYG adopts), under-bullet nested-list guides (reader), HTML comments render nowhere
- [x] **GitHub alerts** (`> [!NOTE]` …) in both views + slash menu + PDF export, five themeable palette tokens, Lucide icons; lenient inline form accepted
- [x] **Syntax highlighting** for fenced code blocks in both views — gpui-component's tree-sitter highlighter (already in the binary), 22 grammars as Cargo features, one app-side cache, themes recolor live
- [x] **Custom fonts** — Settings → Appearance → Font (any installed family or an imported .ttf/.otf, persisted + re-registered at startup); themes can name a `"font"`; full per-token theme overrides (19 palette tokens, #RRGGBBAA)
- [x] **Text size setting** — 14–20px, one value drives all three views; exposed latent size-mismatch bugs (measure vs paint, table hit-testing) now fixed structurally

### Import & export (0.5.0)
- [x] **PDF export** — tab / sidebar right-click "Export as PDF…", File menu, and ⌘P for the active tab; a native save dialog, then `src/export.rs` renders the note's mdast straight to PDF via `oxidize-pdf` (pure Rust; ~10 small new crates with default features off). We own the layout: wrapped styled runs (bold/italic/code) with real font metrics, headings/lists/tasks/quotes/tables/code/footnotes/dividers, page breaks. Render-view fidelity: `$$` math rasterizes through RaTeX, mermaid through mermaid-rs + resvg (gpui's own SVG rasterizer), images of any decodable format via the `image` crate; control comments (`<!-- math:left -->`) never print. Journal tab exports its loaded days under date headings. Known v1 gaps (documented in `export.rs`): inline `$…$` stays as source unless it's a whole paragraph, emoji/CJK degrade under the standard PDF fonts, remote images skipped, quote bars don't span page breaks

### Editor & rendering (v0.4.1)
- [x] **Links in WYSIWYG** — wiki-links (`[[page]]`), tags (`#tag`), inline URLs (`[text](url)`), and PDF references (`[[file.pdf]]`) are now clickable in the WYSIWYG view, matching the reader. Recognition via `markdown_syntax::links()` + `LinkHit` enum (wiki / URL / email); on-click handlers (`EditorEvent::OpenLink` / `OpenWikiLink`) route to navigation or PDF open. Visual affordance: **hover hand cursor** over clickable regions (draw link-grip hitboxes during prepaint, set cursor on paint). See commits 35a95ad (link navigation + cursor), 4c35a09 (caret/image fixes)
- [x] **Images as Word-style atomic objects** — in WYSIWYG, images no longer expose markdown when the caret moves across them; instead, the caret parks **beside** the image (visually like a single unit). Backspace or Delete removes the image + its markdown row, and right-click opens a context menu with **"Delete image"**. Internally: `EditorEvent::DeleteImage` triggers `delete_image_row` (removes the image line), and caret positioning after drop places the caret on the line *below* the markdown to avoid the resize-grip interaction. See commits 4c35a09, 7d0d04e
- [x] **Images: on-drop rendering** — fixed the "hit Enter to make image render" bug. Root cause: `set_text` doesn't emit `EditorEvent::Changed`, so the image wasn't being scanned for initial load. Fixed by having `insert_image_markdown` call `ensure_image_loaded` directly, then the `EditorEvent::Changed` subscriptions handle subsequent rescans. See commit 4c35a09
- [x] **Caret placement after image drop** — caret lands on the line *below* the image markdown to avoid colliding with the resize grip during immediate resize operations. Computed as `pos + snippet.len() + (trailing space offset)`. See commit 4c35a09
- [x] **LaTeX sizing on Linux** — root-cause: WYSIWYG sized math via `texture_px ÷ window_scale_factor` while rasters are fixed DPR=2.0 — cancels only on Retina. Fixed by having math + mermaid providers return logical sizes `(Arc<RenderImage>, f32, f32)` so rendering engines receive the correct size independent of platform DPI. Verified: math now renders at the same size on macOS and Linux X11. See commits 7a5d4f3, 935ba9a
- [x] **Mermaid sizing** — tuned to user preference: `RASTER_SCALE=1.0`, `DISPLAY_SCALE=0.5` (renders at full resolution, displays at half-natural size). Easier to read and consistent with the "smaller" diagrams the user preferred. See commit 935ba9a
- [x] **Search: refocus reopens results** — when a search box already has a query and regains focus (e.g., after navigating), results now reopen automatically instead of requiring a re-edit. Handled via `InputEvent::Focus` subscription (separate from `InputEvent::Change`). See commit 3e0e36d
- [x] **CRT (Green Phosphor) builtin theme** — a new skin inspired by classic CRT monitors (green-on-black aesthetics). Created as a builtin in `skins.rs` (no longer a JSON file) with palette `(bg=#000000, surface=#030703, accent=#33FF33, …)`. Theme tokens (button/slider/ring families) now respect the custom accent color via luminance-aware foreground selection. All gpui-component widget families (tab, button, slider, ring) now properly theme to custom skins. See commits caf3c8d, 87abe5c, 3e0e36d

### Editor & rendering (older)
- [x] **Click-to-caret** — clicking the rendered page **or a journal day** enters edit mode with the caret on the clicked character (empty space → end of the nearest line). gpui-markdown records a rendered→source byte-offset map while rendering (handling stripped `[[ ]]` / `#` / inline-code markup) and resolves a click via gpui's text layout (`index_for_position`); the host places the editor caret (`set_cursor_position`). To keep the clicked line under the cursor (the source layout is more compact than the rendered one), gpui-markdown reports the click's window-y and the host *predicts* the caret's row with the same `LineWrapper` soft-wrap math the editor uses (`predict_caret_row` — mirrors the input's 1.25 rem line height + paddings), jumping the scroll in the same frame so the editor's first paint is already aligned; a stability-gated verify pass (`align_caret_to_click`) mops up drift and rejects the editor's stale first-paint bounds. Near the document top the jump clamps to 0 — the page stays put and the caret just lands visibly. See `crates/gpui-markdown` (`on_click_source`) + `AppView::edit_page_at_offset` / `edit_day_at_offset`
- [x] Slash menu: **click-to-insert** — slash-menu rows are now mouse-driven as well as keyboard-driven: hovering a row moves the selection to it (one highlight shared with the arrow keys) and clicking accepts it like Enter (inserts the snippet or opens a category). Driven from the row's `on_mouse_down` with `stop_propagation` so it fires before the press can blur the editor — the insertion lands and focus stays put. See `src/ui/slash_menu.rs`, `AppView::click_slash` / `slash_hover`
- [x] **Find in page** (`⌘F`) — a find bar above a named page searches the **rendered** text (not the editor, which clashes with click-to-edit): every match highlights, the active one emphasized, with an *n / m* count; Enter/⇧Enter or ↑/↓ step (scrolling the match into view), Esc closes. `⌘⇧F` focuses the global note search; the journal feed defers to it. The search core lives in **`gpui-markdown`** — a reusable, db-free `find_matches` + `MarkdownView::search` / `track_blocks` (operates only on the source string) — with the find bar, shortcuts, and scroll in the host. See `src/ui/page_view.rs`, `crates/gpui-markdown/src/lib.rs`
- [x] **Configurable date/time format** — a **Settings → General** pane chooses the date (ISO / US / European / long / day-month-year) and time (24-hour / 12-hour) styles used by `/date`, `/time`, and the `{{date}}` / `{{time}}` placeholders; persisted, ISO + 24-hour by default. Date helpers consolidated into `src/dates.rs`; journal day headers keep their own long format. See `src/dates.rs`, `src/settings.rs`
- [x] **As-you-type completion** — `[[` (pages, with a "Create" entry), `#` (tags), and `{{` (template placeholders); reuses the slash popup, ranks matches, and caps the list so it stays usable with many pages
- [x] **Auto-pair brackets/quotes** (`()` `[]` `{}` `<>` `""` `''`) with type-over and prose-safe guards (contraction-aware quotes, `<` only after a word); confirming a `[[`/`{{` completion absorbs the auto-inserted closer
- [x] Auto-pair: **wrap the selection** — typing an opener with text selected wraps it (`foo` → `(foo)`); done in the change handler by diffing against the prior text, no key-level interception needed
- [x] Auto-pair: **backspace deletes an empty pair** (`(|)` + backspace → remove both)
- [x] **Inline image rendering** — standalone `![](path-or-url)` images render for real (async, aspect-ratio preserved, capped to content width); an image at the start of a paragraph renders with trailing text as a caption below
- [x] **Note-image memory** — local images go through `images::ImageStore`: decoded **downscaled to display size** (`DynamicImage::thumbnail`, longest edge ≤ 2048 — a 12 MP phone photo is ~12 MB of RGBA instead of ~47 MB) into a GPU-ready `RenderImage`, decoded **one at a time** (a serialized queue, so only one full-res decode buffer is ever alive), and **freed on view change** (`cx.drop_image` for CPU + GPU atlas, like the PDF viewer — gpui never auto-evicts a `RenderImage`). Before this, a note's photos decoded at full native resolution and were never released, so RAM climbed without bound as you browsed photo pages (the synthetic perf DBs had no real images, so it only surfaced after the Logseq import). Remaining: `image` 0.25 can't DCT-decode JPEGs at reduced size, so a full-res buffer is still briefly allocated and macOS's allocator keeps it as a bounded ~50 MB reclaimable cache (`MALLOC_LARGE (empty)`); a frugal/zune decoder path could remove even that. See `src/images.rs`, `AppView::ensure_image_loaded` / `pump_image_decodes` / `release_images`
- [x] Image **resize** — drag the corner handle (live preview); persists as `![](src){width=N}` in the markdown
- [x] Image **insert** — paste from clipboard (`Cmd+V`) or drag-and-drop a file; copied into the data-dir `images/` folder and referenced relatively
- [x] Image **fit-to-view** (`⌘⇧I`) — shrink every image in the active page / journal that renders wider than ~half the content column back down to that size, so an image dragged, pasted, or **imported with no `{width}`** stops dominating the page. Width-less images are handled too: the size comes from the painted measurement (`image_widths`), not just an explicit `{width=N}`, and all images are enumerated via a new `gpui_markdown::images()`. Until fit, an over-wide image **scrolls horizontally within its own row** (keeping its resize grip reachable) instead of running off the page, while sibling text keeps wrapping at the normal width. See `AppView::on_fit_images` / `apply_fit`, `src/ui/image.rs`
- [x] **Task-list checkboxes** (`- [ ]` / `- [x]`) — rendered via mdast `ListItem.checked` (the field does exist after all)
- [x] `gpui-markdown` now covers CommonMark + GFM: footnotes, reference-style `[text][id]` links/images, and raw HTML (shown literally)
- [x] **Mermaid diagrams** — a ` ```mermaid ` block renders as a diagram (flowchart / sequence / class / state). Pure-Rust, **no JS**: the [`mermaid-rs-renderer`](https://github.com/zed-industries/mermaid-rs-renderer) crate (the one Zed's markdown preview uses) lays it out to SVG, then gpui's built-in SVG rasterizer turns that into a `RenderImage`. Rendered off-thread and cached by source text (mirroring `ImageStore`), with a "Rendering…" placeholder and a fall-back to the code on failure. **Themed to the live skin** — `mermaid::current_theme()` maps Zorite's palette onto the diagram theme (translucent tokens composited over the page background so colours land right), and the cache is dropped in `apply_theme` so diagrams re-colour when you switch skin / light-dark. `gpui-markdown` stays renderer-agnostic via an `on_mermaid` hook (sibling of `on_image`). **Click a diagram to expand it** in a full-window, scrollable lightbox (dimmed backdrop or × to close). Follow-ups: match the UI font, render at display DPI for crispness. See `src/mermaid.rs`, `src/ui/mermaid.rs`, `crates/gpui-markdown` (`on_mermaid`)
- [x] `/time` and `/date` slash commands — insert the current time/date directly (distinct from the `{{time}}` / `{{date}}` *template* placeholders, which only expand inside a template)
- [x] **Headings nested in list items** — markdown like `- # Heading` now renders the heading with proper size/weight in WYSIWYG (previously displayed as plain text). Parser recognizes heading markers post-list-marker via shared `apply_heading` function. See commit 7d81518
- [x] **Line height tuning** — adjusted `LINE_HEIGHT_RATIO` to 1.45 (from 1.35) for better readability in normal text while maintaining good visual balance. See commit e928638
- [x] **Journal midnight-rollover fix** — journal entries now correctly appear for a new day after an overnight absence. Root cause: `ensure_feed_loaded` wasn't checking if today's date changed; the feed was cached with yesterday's bounds. Fixed by adding a `day_editors.contains_key(&date_for_offset(0))` guard to refresh the day if the offset has rolled. See commit 59b8add

### Notes & navigation
- [x] **Page rename** (and rewrite `[[links]]` pointing at it) — right-click → Rename page → dialog; `db.rename_page` rewrites links in a transaction
- [x] **Page hierarchy** via `[[parent::child]]` — Logseq-style: the `::` path *is* the page title, so the sidebar tree and each page's "Sub-pages" index are derived from titles (no parent column). Intermediate namespace segments show as virtual nodes and materialize on click. See `src/hierarchy.rs`
- [x] **Page aliases** — a subdued `alias::` field under the page title takes a comma list of alternate names; `[[name]]` then resolves to that page (exact title wins). Stored in a `page_aliases` table; resolution lives in `get_or_create_page`, so links and backlinks follow it
- [x] **Sidebar shows recent pages** — the page tree is capped to the last 10 *viewed* named pages (persisted in `settings`; seeded from the most-recently-edited pages on first run). Reach the rest via search
- [x] **Type-aware search** — the global search returns the PDF and image *files* referenced in notes, not just pages. A `pdf:` / `img:` / `page:` prefix (or a results-pane chip with a live per-kind count) filters by kind; `pdf:` / `img:` with no term browses every file in the managed `pdf/` / `images/` store. A PDF hit opens the viewer, an image opens the page showing it, a page opens the page. Files are extracted from the FTS-matched pages (`gpui_markdown::images` + the wiki-link index) rather than a separate file index. See `src/search.rs`, `src/ui/search.rs`
- [x] Journal: jump-to-date — a sidebar calendar date picker opens any day (creating it if needed)
- [x] Rename: whitespace + alias-label link variants rewrite (2026-07-03) — `[[ Foo ]]` and `[[Foo|nick]]` follow a rename (fenced code untouched; `mentions::rewrite_wiki_links` on the shared links grammar). **Case variants (`[[FOO]]`) deliberately left alone** — that casing reads as the writer's choice, and links resolve case-insensitively anyway
- [x] Hierarchy follow-ups: cascade-rename a namespace (renaming `Foo` retitles `Foo::*` children and rewrites their exact `[[links]]`, atomically — any child collision aborts the whole rename); sidebar right-click → "New sub-page" (the New-page dialog pre-filled with `Parent::`)
- [x] Unlinked references (2026-07-03) — an "UNLINKED REFERENCES" panel under Linked References: word-bounded, case-insensitive title mentions outside links/tags/code (`src/mentions.rs`, built on the shared `syntax::links` grammar; whiteboard JSON excluded), each row with a one-click **Link** that wraps that source's mentions as `[[links]]` and re-indexes
- [x] **Auto-link existing page titles as you type** (2026-07-03) — a completed word or trailing phrase (up to 4 words) matching an existing page title (case-insensitive, 3+ chars) wraps as `[[Canonical Title]]` on the boundary keystroke. Settings → Markdown toggle (default off, persisted); one undo step reverts a wrap; never fires inside code, `[[ ]]`, tags, or `[text](` syntax. Editor side is a generic `set_auto_replace` hook; the matcher + title cache live in the app
- [x] Sidebar: **"All pages" browser** (2026-07-03) — a list-icon in the sidebar toolbar opens an index tab of every named page and whiteboard: an A–Z / 0–9 / `#` strip filters by first character (letters with no matches dim; clicking the active letter clears), kind chips (All / Pages / Whiteboards) compose with it, each row shows a type badge, and clicking opens the page or canvas. Journal days excluded by design (the calendar is their browser). See `src/ui/all_pages.rs`
- [x] Calendar: entry markers (2026-07-03) — the jump-to-date overlay is a hand-rolled month grid (`src/ui/month_cal.rs`; gpui-component's Calendar has no per-day decoration hook): an accent dot + brighter number on days with non-empty entries, today outlined, ‹ › month nav, click any day to jump

### Whiteboards
The freeform `gpui-whiteboard` canvas — a reusable, host-agnostic crate (like `gpui-markdown` / `gpui-pdf`) for an infinite, pannable/zoomable board of shapes, arrows, freehand, text, images, and page-cards, linkable to pages. A distinct surface from the text journal. Design: [docs/whiteboard-architecture.md](docs/whiteboard-architecture.md). **Feature-complete** — the milestones:
- [x] **Pan mode** — a dedicated pan tool (✋) that's the default tool; left-drag pans with a grab cursor (double-click recenters, middle-drag still pans)
- [x] **Multiple page management** — boards are first-class pages now: "New" makes a distinct board (`create_whiteboard`), a "Whiteboards" sidebar section lists them (open / rename / delete / favorite), and they're searchable by title (`wb:` + a Whiteboards chip)
- [x] **Keyboard shortcuts** — tool keys (H/V/P/R/O/L/A/T), ⌫/Del to delete the selection, ⌘Z / ⌘⇧Z undo-redo, Esc to deselect; the board takes focus on a canvas click, and tooltips show the keys
- [x] **Toolbar tooltips** — hover label on every tool / action / color button (a self-rendered themed `Tip`, since the bar is icon-only)
- [x] **Organize the toolbar** — categories on the main bar (`Pan · Select · Color │ Shapes & Text ▾ · Pages & Images ▾ │ Undo · Redo · Delete`); each category button shows its group's active/representative tool + a `▾` and opens a click-to-toggle flyout of that group's tools (picking one activates it + closes); flyout also closes on a canvas press or when the color picker opens
- [x] **More shapes** — diamond, triangle, rounded rectangle, hexagon, 5-point star. All ride the shared `box_like` machinery (bounds / select / resize / rotate / fill) like rect & ellipse; polygons via a generic `paint_box_polygon`, rounded-rect via `paint_round_rect`. New flyout entries + shortcuts (D / G / U / S / X)
- [x] **Snap to grid** — hold ⌥ Option while dragging to snap to the 24px dot grid: create snaps both box corners / line endpoints, move snaps the primary element's top-left (the rest follow), resize / group-resize snap the dragged corner, and line/arrow endpoint-drag snaps the endpoint. Freehand and rotation are unaffected (`snap_grid` helper)
- [x] **Picture / image uploads** — add images via the image tool (Pages & Images → file picker), paste (⌘V on a board), or drag-drop from Finder. Stored in the managed `images/` dir and decoded by the shared `ImageStore` (off-thread, downscaled-to-display, GPU-texture-managed). Image element behaves like a page-card (move + aspect-locked resize), rendered as an overlay from a host `ImageFn` callback. Crate stays host-agnostic via `ImageFn`/`PlaceImageFn`/`DropFilesFn`
- [x] **Image rotation** — images rotate in **90° steps** (the rotate handle snaps to quarter turns). gpui can't transform a raster sprite, so the host pre-rotates the pixels (`imageops::rotate90/180/270` — exact, no resampling or bounding-box growth) and caches one bitmap per `(src, quarter-turn)`, freed on view change — bounded RAM, vs. the per-degree texture churn an arbitrary angle would cause. The element box + selection snap to 90° to track the bitmap, and the `img` is sized by width only so it fills the rotated AABB without gpui's forced `aspect_ratio` overflow-clipping it
- [x] **Templates** — reusable groups of elements. Multi-select → right-click → "Save as template" (a self-rendered canvas menu) → name dialog → stored in a global `whiteboard_templates` DB table (schema v7). A dedicated **Templates** toolbar button (2×2-grid icon, separate from the tool icons) opens a **modal gallery**: a scrim + centered panel of large preview cards (scrollable grid, hover highlight, empty state); click a card to stamp it (centered in the viewport, selected), right-click to delete (with confirm); Esc / scrim / ✕ close it. Crate stays host-agnostic via `Template` + `set_templates`/`on_save_template`/`on_delete_template`
- [x] **Z-order** — Bring to Front / Bring Forward / Send Backward / Send to Back, via a right-click menu (any selection) and shortcuts (⌘] / ⌘[ one step, ⌘⇧] / ⌘⇧[ all the way). The board paints as a true z-ordered stack — canvas "bands" (shapes / lines / pen / text) interleaved with image and page-card overlay divs in element order — so a shape can sit above *or* below an image or card (you can finally draw over an image). Reorder is a stable partition (to front/back) or a neighbour swap (one step), moving a multi-selection as a block, with undo + persist
- [x] **Copy / cut / paste** — ⌘C / ⌘X / ⌘V and a right-click Copy / Cut / Paste, through the system clipboard so a selection moves across boards and windows. Copy writes a tagged `zorite-whiteboard-v1` string (the template serialization); paste prefers it over a clipboard image and stamps the group centered + selected with fresh ids. Crate stays host-agnostic via `CopyFn` / `PasteFn`; ⌘C/⌘X/⌘V are handled in the crate (not a host action, which the board's key context wouldn't fire)
- [x] **Stroke thickness** — a thickness control next to the color swatch: a flyout of preset weights (1 / 2.5 / 4 / 6 / 9 px) over a drag slider for any custom width (reusing the color picker's drag-strip machinery). Sets the weight for new elements and applies to the selection, stored zoom-independently (`active_width / zoom`) so it stays consistent on screen
- [x] **Saved-color palette** — a "Saved" column in the color picker (beside the gradient controls): `+` saves the current color, swatches apply on click / remove on right-click. Global, persisted in `settings` and synced across open boards; host-agnostic via `SavedColorsFn` + `set_saved_colors`. Sized to the space the one-line theme-swatch row leaves, so the panel crops to that row and saved colors wrap rather than run off the edge
- [x] **Per-axis resize** — edge-midpoint handles (between the corners) *stretch* one axis, on a single element **or** a multi-selection; the corners still scale proportionally. Each element scales from its grab-time geometry about the opposite edge: axis-aligned shapes / pen / cards are exact, an image distorts (its corners stay aspect-locked, so corner = safe, edge = free-stretch), and a rotated box scales along its own axes — the pragmatic tradeoff, since a true world-axis shear isn't representable. Text and rotated elements keep corners only (a single font size can't stretch one axis; a rotated box's edges aren't world-axis-aligned). Crate-only (`ResizeHandle` + `axis_scale`, feeding the existing `resize_about`)
- [x] **Custom / uploaded fonts** — a per-board text face: an **"Aa"** toolbar button opens a flyout to *upload* a `.ttf`/`.otf` (validated as a real face, copied into a managed `fonts/` dir, persisted per board in `settings`) or *revert to default* (bundled JetBrains Mono). The chosen face is restored when the board reopens. The crate stays host-agnostic via `FontPick` + `set_on_pick_font` (it already consumed font bytes through `set_font` / `Font::from_bytes`)
- [x] **Text boxes edit like a real text field** — click any letter to place the caret, click-drag / double-click to select (word), ⇧ + arrows / click to extend, arrows / Home / End / ⌘A to navigate, and type / Backspace / Delete + ⌘C / ⌘X / ⌘V relative to the caret/selection. Built from scratch on the vector-font layout (no text-input widget): `font.rs` gained per-char caret positions (`caret_pos`), click→offset hit-testing (`index_at`), and selection rects; the view carries a caret + selection-anchor model wired through click / drag / keyboard, with the caret + a translucent highlight rendered inline (and following the text's rotation). Replaces the old append/backspace-only buffer
- [x] **Movable toolbar** — a dotted grip at the left of the tool pill drags the whole toolbar anywhere on the canvas (clamped on-board; double-click the grip resets it to top-center). Tapping **`R`** mid-drag flips the bar between a row and a column (dividers reorient, flyouts/picker move to the bar's right). Flyouts and the color picker follow it, and the position + orientation persist globally in `settings` (synced across open boards). The pill is no longer occluded — a press routes through the canvas by captured bounds (the color picker's pattern), so the buttons still click. Crate stays host-agnostic via `MoveToolbarFn` + `set_toolbar_pos` / `set_toolbar_vertical`
- [x] **Text in shapes** — double-click any closed shape (rect / ellipse / diamond / triangle / rounded-rect / hexagon / star) to add a centered label that **auto-shrinks + word-wraps to fit inside the outline** (per-shape inscribed-rectangle factors, à la Excalidraw, with padding), editable with the full caret / selection / clipboard like a text box. It inks with the shape's stroke unless recolored via a new **Text** category in the color picker. Closes #10. See `crates/gpui-whiteboard` (`shape_label_block`, `EditTarget`)
- [x] **Rich text formatting** — per-character **bold / italic / underline / strikethrough / highlight** on any board text (free text *or* shape labels), over a selection or armed for typing with none. Three entry points share one ✓-marked panel: keyboard (⌘B / ⌘I / ⌘U / ⇧⌘X / ⇧⌘H), a right-click **Text ▸** fly-out, and a toolbar **A** fly-out. Stored as style runs in the scene; italic + bold are synthetic (a shear + a stroke over the solid fill) so they work with any uploaded face. See `crates/gpui-whiteboard` (`RunStyle` / `StyleSpan`, `font::layout_styled`)

### Performance
- [x] **Journal feed cost at scale** — DONE (2026-07-03): the content-keyed parse cache shipped in `gpui-markdown` (`parse_cached`: exact-source key, Arc'd mdast, 64-entry LRU, thread-local so all windows share it) — feed re-renders now cache-hit every non-editing day. True windowing remains unexplored (and likely unneeded). Original analysis: — lower priority now that lazy-load bounds the common case: the feed starts at 14 days and only grows by `FEED_CHUNK` (7) on scroll-to-bottom / "Load older days", capped at `FEED_MAX_DAYS` (3650), so a typical session mounts only a couple dozen days. The latent issue is the *per-day* cost, not the day count: `journal::render` mounts every loaded day in a plain `for i in 0..loaded_days` loop (gpui lays out all children — Taffy doesn't virtualize a plain div — and culls only *paint*), and `MarkdownView` is `RenderOnce` with **no parse cache**, so every feed re-render re-parses every non-editing day's markdown (`to_mdast`), i.e. O(loaded_days × content). Fine at tens of days; a heavy scroller (hundreds of days) who then interacts pays a full re-parse each render. **Cheaper first step than true virtualization:** a content-keyed parse cache in `gpui-markdown` (memoize the mdast / built element by source hash) kills the dominant cost without touching the scroll model. True windowing is a poorer fit — days are variable-height, so gpui's `uniform_list` doesn't apply; it'd need `gpui::list` or a custom windowing scheme.
- [x] **Lighter `list_pages`** — the page list loads `id`/`title` only (not content): ~4× faster and memory-flat at scale (50k pages: 103 ms → 28 ms; RAM ~flat 10k→50k). See the [Performance](README.md#performance) section
- [x] **Full-text search index** — a trigram FTS5 index over page title + content (external-content, kept in sync by triggers) replaces the old `LIKE` table scan: same case-insensitive *substring* matching, now indexed so it scales. Migration `v4→v5` populates existing pages; queries < 3 chars (trigram's minimum) fall back to LIKE. See `src/db.rs`

### Data & migrations
- [x] **Back up before migrating** — `Db::open` snapshots the database to `zorite.db.bak-v<N>` (WAL-checkpointed first, so the copy is complete) before any schema upgrade, so a buggy migration is recoverable. One snapshot per source version. See `Db::backup_before_migration`
- [x] **Transactional migrations** — every step (`v0→2`, `v2→3`, `v3→4`, `v4→5`) now runs inside a transaction, so a mid-migration failure rolls back cleanly instead of leaving a half-migrated DB
- [x] **Friendlier migration failure** — a failed open no longer silently drops the user into blank notes: it falls back to a temporary in-memory store and shows a one-time dialog explaining what happened, with **Reveal Backup** (points at the `.bak-v<N>` snapshot) and **Quit**. See `AppView::show_db_error_dialog`

### App & polish
- [x] **Settings: switches + a filter box** — the Updates pane's "Automatically check for updates" / "Include pre-releases" are toggle switches (matching the WYSIWYG one), not On/Off dropdowns. A header filter box narrows the panes Baudrun-style: cards and nav tabs that don't match the typed text fade to ~0.3 (but stay interactive), with a × to clear; matching is each card's title + a keyword index (`SECTIONS`). See `src/settings.rs`
- [x] **Collapsible sidebar** — a `<` caret collapses it to a thin icon rail (`>` to expand, plus the calendar/settings icons); the content area reclaims the space
- [x] Sidebar: **truncate over-long titles to the rail width** — a title wider than the rail is clipped with an ellipsis (rows stretch to the rail and `.truncate()`), so a row and its selection highlight never run past the sidebar edge; the full title shows in a tooltip on hover (measured per row via `text_system().layout_line`, so the tooltip appears only when actually clipped). Replaces the earlier horizontal-scroll-on-overflow approach. See `src/ui/sidebar.rs`
- [x] Sidebar: **Favorites group** — right-click a page → **Add/Remove from favorites** pins it to a "Favorites" section above "Recent", shown by **full title** (so `Foo::Bar` is unambiguous, unlike the leaf-nested recent tree). Persists across launches as a comma-separated id list in `settings` (mirrors `recent_pages`, no migration); the section hides when empty, and a deleted page drops out of favorites. Recent and favorites rows share one `page_row` builder. See `src/ui/sidebar.rs`, `AppView::toggle_favorite`
- [x] Sidebar: **collapsible namespace nodes** — a node with children shows a disclosure chevron (`▸`/`⌄`) in a gutter at the start of every tree row; clicking it hides/shows the subtree (the click stops propagation so it doesn't also open the page). Collapsed paths persist across launches (newline-separated in `settings`). The indent guides from the previous item align under each parent's chevron. See `src/ui/sidebar.rs`, `AppView::toggle_collapsed`
- [x] Sidebar: **collapsible sections** — each section header (Favorites / Whiteboards / Recent) is clickable, with a disclosure chevron at the right end of its rule; collapsing hides that section's rows. Collapsed sections persist across launches (newline-separated keys in `settings`, mirroring the node-collapse plumbing). The "new whiteboard" action moved out of the Whiteboards header to a `Frame`-icon button in the sidebar's top toolbar (next to new-page / calendar / settings, both labelled by tooltips). See `src/ui/sidebar.rs` (`section_header`), `AppView::toggle_section`
- [x] **Multi-window** — right-click a sidebar page or a tab → "Open in new window" opens a full, independent second window focused on that page (`AppView::open_in_new_window`). Each window is its own `AppView` with its own SQLite connection to the same file. See `src/app.rs`, `src/ui/tab_bar.rs`
- [x] Multi-window: **drag a tab anywhere** — reorder within the strip (drop over a tab), **move it to another open window** by dropping on *that window's tab bar* (it's added there, activated, and the window is focused), or **tear it into a new window** by releasing on content / outside any window, *including onto the desktop* (the new window opens under the cursor). gpui drag-and-drop is per-window, so the source window — which keeps OS mouse capture for the whole drag — owns the release: a strip drop reorders via the tab's `on_drop`; otherwise the root's `on_mouse_up` / `on_mouse_up_out` runs `on_tab_drag_release`, which reads the release point in global coords (`window.bounds().origin + mouse_position`) and finds a target via `GlobalAppWindows`. **Detection is per-tab-bar, not per-window**: each window records its strip's rect each paint (`tab_strip_bounds`, captured by a `canvas`), and a move only fires when the cursor is over another window's *strip* — so a window hidden behind the source isn't picked off its overlapping area, and releasing over your own strip is a "keep here" no-op (drag back to the strip to cancel). It's a gpui-internal drag (a `DraggingTab`, never a native file promise), so releasing on the desktop **never writes a file there** — the trap hit in Baudrun. While dragging, the source's `on_drag_move` lights up the strip under the cursor (`GlobalDropTarget`), which shows a translucent **ghost tab** where the tab would land (repainted cross-window via `cx.notify`). Right-click "Open in new window" still *moves* the tab. Wayland: the compositor controls new-window placement. Known edge: with no window z-order from gpui, a target window's strip that's *hidden behind* the source's content can still match — drop on a visible tab bar. See `src/app.rs`, `src/ui/tab_bar.rs`
- [x] Multi-window: **live cross-window sync** — a shared `DocSignal` (gpui global, one per process) is emitted on content saves (`save_page_content`) AND structural changes (create / rename / delete + the blur link re-index); other windows run `apply_external_edit`, reloading changed journal days, the active page (content + backlinks), and the sidebar page-list (via value-comparison, so only stale data is touched and the editing window never clobbers itself)
- [x] **App icon + packaging** — cargo-packager builds `.app`/`.dmg`, NSIS `.exe`, `.deb`/`.AppImage`, `.rpm`, etc.; a custom app icon ships (Windows PE icon embedded via `build.rs`; `.icns`/`.ico`/`.png`). See `Cargo.toml` `[package.metadata.packager]`
- [x] **CI** — GitHub Actions builds + `cargo test --workspace` across macOS / Windows / Linux (5 runners) and publishes a prerelease on `vX.Y.Z-beta.N` tags. See `.github/workflows/`
- [x] **Keyboard shortcuts + menu bar** — standard cross-OS shortcuts via gpui's `secondary-` (Cmd on macOS / Ctrl elsewhere): New Tab `⌘T`, New Window `⌘N`, Close Tab `⌘W`, Settings `⌘,`, Quit `⌘Q`, Next/Prev Tab `Ctrl+Tab` / `Ctrl+Shift+Tab`. Native macOS menu bar (Zorite / File / Edit / View) via `cx.set_menus`; the Edit menu reuses gpui-component's input actions. A read-only **Settings → Keyboard** section lists them all. `⌘F` finds in the current page and `⌘⇧F` focuses the global search (see **Find in page**). See `src/actions.rs`, `src/main.rs`
- [x] Window-bounds persistence (2026-07-03) — Settings → General → "Remember window position": live-saved on move/resize (maximized tracked, fullscreen skipped) to a DB-free sidecar file (`window-bounds` — needed before an encrypted DB unlocks; file presence = on/off), restored at launch when the saved rect still touches a connected display
- [x] **`LICENSE` file** — the full GNU GPL-3.0 text at the repo root, matching the `GPL-3.0-or-later` already declared in `Cargo.toml`

### Import & export
- [x] **Logseq import** — `File → Import from Logseq…` picks a graph folder and imports `pages/` + `journals/` + `whiteboards/` (draws, config, `bak`/`.recycle` are skipped). Namespaces map to Zorite's (`Budget___2024.md` files and `[[Budget/2024]]` links → `Budget::2024`); the all-bullets outline converts per a user choice — **flatten** (top-level bullets → paragraphs/headings, children stay lists) or **keep bullets**; `TODO`/`DONE`/`CANCELED` → task checkboxes; Logseq-internal properties (`id::`, `collapsed::`, …) drop while user properties stay as text; `title::`/`alias::` feed the page title and alias table; `{{video}}`/`{{embed}}`/`((block-ref))` resolve and queries stay visible as inline code; glued code fences (` ```cfg… `) are normalized; assets copy into `images/` + `pdf/` (percent-decoded, sanitized names) with refs rewritten (`[[pdf/x.pdf]]` chips); Logseq `hls__*` PDF-highlight pages convert to Zorite's `<name>.pdf (highlights)` format. **Whiteboards** (`whiteboards/*.edn`, tldraw EDN — a minimal EDN reader in `src/import/edn.rs`) convert to native Zorite boards: text, boxes (with their `:label` as the shape's native auto-fit label), ellipses, lines, **arrows** (`:decorations {:end/:start "arrow"}`), freehand, and embedded base64 **images** (under `:pages → :logseq.tldraw.page → :assets`, decoded into `images/wb-*.png`); web-embeds and page-portal cards have no equivalent and are skipped (warned per board). **Favorites** (`config.edn` `:favorites`) map to the sidebar Favorites list. Existing pages/days keep their content (import appends below, reported in the summary). Runs on a background thread against its own DB connection; `ZORITE_DATA` env (new) isolates a whole test data set. **Extensible by design**: each source is a *reader* module producing a source-agnostic `ImportBundle` (pages, journal days, asset copies + decoded byte-assets, whiteboards, favorites), and one engine (`import::write_bundle`) owns the collision policy, link/alias indexing, and asset copying — adding Obsidian/Notion/… is a new reader plus a menu entry (see the "Adding an importer" doc in `src/import/mod.rs`). See `src/import/` (engine + `logseq.rs` reader, both unit-tested end to end), `AppView::on_import_logseq`
- [x] In-app **PDF viewer** — `[[file.pdf]]` / `![](file.pdf)` open a dedicated viewer tab (`ui::pdf_view`); pages are sized from `render_dimensions()` for instant layout. Closing the tab frees both the CPU images and their **GPU atlas textures** (`cx.drop_image` — raw `RenderImage`s are never auto-evicted; this was an ~140 MB/open leak). See `src/pdf.rs`
- [x] PDF: **viewport virtualization** — only the on-screen pages (±2) are rasterized; far ones are evicted (image + GPU texture), so memory is bounded by the viewport, not the page count (`AppView::ensure_pdf_window` + `pdf_view::keep_window`). Verified: scrolling a 32-page PDF end-to-end holds ~178 MB vs 403 MB before
- [x] PDF: **DPI-aware render scale** — pages rasterize at display pixel-ratio × zoom × a host **quality** multiplier (no longer a fixed 1.5×); a render-quality slider in Settings trades sharpness for speed (default 75%), read reactively so open viewers re-render live
- [x] PDF: **zoom + page navigation** — − / + / reset (⌘= / ⌘- / ⌘0) and ‹ / › with a click-to-edit page-number input (+ PageUp / PageDown / Home / End); no blank on zoom/quality change (the old bitmap stays, rescaled, until the crisp one lands)
- [x] PDF: **extracted to a reusable [`gpui-pdf`](crates/gpui-pdf/README.md) crate** — host-agnostic primitives + a self-contained `PdfView` component; markup is behind an optional `markup` feature
- [x] PDF: **Logseq-style text markup** — drag-to-highlight in the viewer writes a reference block (`- pN: quote {color} [[file.pdf#pN|↗]]`) on a per-PDF "(highlights)" page; clicking the ↗ opens the PDF and scrolls to + **flashes** the highlight. Done **dep-free** — a custom hayro `Device` extracts text + glyph rects (only `kurbo`, *not* oxidize-pdf). Has a **color picker** (yellow/green/blue/pink/orange) and header **tooltips**
- [x] PDF: **find-in-PDF** — a browser-style find bar (🔍 / ⌘F) over the text layer: type to search the whole document, matches boxed + a focused one outlined, `n / N` count, Enter/⇧Enter to step (scroll-to), Esc to close. Behind a `search` feature (= `["markup"]`, shares the text layer). See `gpui-pdf` `find_matches` + `src/pdf.rs`
- [x] PDF: **outline / table-of-contents** — reads `/Catalog /Outlines` via `hayro-syntax` into `gpui_pdf::outline()`; a toggle (≡, by the title) opens a navigable, level-indented TOC panel that jumps to each page (hidden when there's no outline). Also extracts `/Link` annotations (`page_links`) → clickable in-page links (internal jumps + external URLs), and bulleted highlight selections store as a nested markdown list. See `crates/gpui-pdf/src/outline.rs`
- [x] PDF: **password-protected files** — an encrypted PDF opens behind a prompt (masked field, Enter or a button to submit, "incorrect password" on a wrong try) instead of a blank pane; hayro 0.7.2 decrypts RC4 / AES-128 / AES-256 (standard security handler) via `Pdf::new_with_password`. The prompt UI lives in the app so `gpui-pdf` stays gpui-component-free: `PdfView` keeps the bytes, reports `is_locked()` / `unlock_failed()` and retries via `unlock(password)`, emitting `PdfEvent::LockChanged` so the host swaps prompt ↔ viewer. Unsupported handlers (public-key / certificate) still need the fallback above. See `crates/gpui-pdf` (README + `lib.rs`), `src/app.rs`
