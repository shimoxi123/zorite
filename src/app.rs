//! `AppView` — the root view. The content area is a set of **tabs**: a
//! pinned **Journal** tab (an infinite, reverse-chronological feed of daily
//! entries, today on top, older days lazy-loaded) plus a tab per opened
//! **page** (one editor + a "Linked References" panel). Left-click a sidebar
//! page to open/focus its tab; right-click → "Open in new tab" opens it in
//! the background. The sidebar search box shows results over the active tab
