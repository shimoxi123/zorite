//! SQLite storage for Zorite (v2): each page is a single markdown
//! document, plus a `[[wiki-link]]` index over pages for backlinks.
//!
//! Schema v2 replaces the v1 block-outliner model. New databases get v2
//! directly; existing v1 databases are migrated in place — each page's
//! blocks are folded into a markdown bullet list so nothing is lost.
//!
//! Timestamps come from SQLite (`datetime('now')` defaults). Everything
//! runs synchronously on the UI thread (tiny working set).
