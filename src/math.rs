//! Math block rendering: a `$$…$$` block's LaTeX, typeset by `ratex-gpui` (a RaTeX port) to
//! a `gpui::RenderImage`. Renders are expensive, so they run off-thread and are cached here,
//! keyed by the block's LaTeX — mirroring [`crate::mermaid::MermaidStore`]. Unlike Mermaid's
//! vector SVG, RaTeX rasters are pixel-sized, so each slot also carries the image's logical
//! (pre-DPR) px size, for display at the right scale.
